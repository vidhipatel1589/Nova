# Nova

**Description:** Networking application for individuals looking to expand their network by matching with people with similar goals and attending career-centric events with their new connections.

**Built With:** Figma, JavaScript, React Native, Expo Snack

**Inspiration:** Entering the job market and expanding your career network without a friend or mentor can be intimidating.

## What it does
NOVA helps get you out of your comfort zone and expand your connections. The app will ask the user to take a quiz and select events the user would like to go to. NOVA will then collect that data and match the user with another user who would also like to go to the same event.

## How we built it
We first created a mockup of the mobile app using Figma and then coded it in JavaScript/JSX using React Native. We used Expo to view and test our mobile application as we developed it.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenges we faced were having to learn a new language and using software we were unfamiliar with. At first, we tried setting up an environment using Flutter, but after consideration, we made the decision to pivot and use React Native, which ended up aligning really well with the goals that we hoped to achieve with the development of NOVA.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of how much we were able to do in 24 hours. We implemented almost all of the features that we wanted to and our app turned out how we envisioned it to. We're also proud of the fact that despite meeting just 24 hours ago, we formed such a strong team in which we prioritized communication and worked in a focused and dedicated manner towards all the tasks we had to complete.

## What we learned
Due to the limited time frame of our project, we learned to pivot and adapt when ideas or features were no longer ideal to implement. â€‹We also learned early on that focusing on a few main features was more efficient than creating multiple small features.

## What's next for NOVA
We plan to implement a location verification to ensure users are actually going to the events. We also hope to introduce a gamification aspect in which users can gain points by attending events and making connections, and they can trade in these points for prizes.
